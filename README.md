# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
It is developed to access Mars photos from NASA Open API. Users can show the photos taken by Curiosity Rover from it's landing day to recent days. 
Just click to choose a day and show photos for that day. When a list of photos comes into the screen, users can go forwards by clicking a specific photo to see it in more details.
